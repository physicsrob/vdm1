# Ordering
I have not yet placed the production board order.  My best estimate is that it will take approximately 30 days to fulfill your order, but please keep in mind this is a hobby project and not a commercial venture.

There are three options for building this board:

1. (Recommended) You can purchase a partial kit by filling out this [order form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQnacN6HaIYNkcyuC9uvQUqtpV_DN6gmrP4U9IGy-mbRbPOw/viewform?usp=sf_link).  Select "partial kit" when filling out the form, and afterward I will send you a paypal invoice for your order.  The partial kit includes:

- The VDM-2021 PCB
- Character generator ROM (either MCM6574P or MCM66740)
- 8 2102 memory chips
- 1 DM8131 bus comparator
- 1 DS8836N bus receiver
- 1 93L16 binary counter
- 1 heat sink
- 1 BNC PCB connector 

  
2. You can order a bare printed circuit board by filling out this [order form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQnacN6HaIYNkcyuC9uvQUqtpV_DN6gmrP4U9IGy-mbRbPOw/viewform?usp=sf_link).  Select "Bare PCB Only" when filling out the form.  I will send you a paypal invoice for your order.  You will be, of course, responsible for sourcing your own components.
 
3.  You can print your own board.  I'm hoping that initial orders will go through me, but long term anyone can print this board.  The kicad PCB design is available on [github](https://github.com/physicsrob/vdm1).
