1.) LOAD BASIC

2.) LEAVE AT LEAST 512 BYTES OF MEMORY FREE ABOVE YOUR RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION "MEMORY SIZE? " DURING THE INITIALIZATION OF BASIC.  THERE MUST BE ROOM FOR THE DRIVER ABOVE BASIC!  EXAMPLE: IF YOU HAVE 20K OF MEMORY THEN THE DECIMAL EQUIVALENT IS 20480. 20480-512 = 19968 WHICH IS THE MAXIMUM VALUE YOU SHOULD TYPE FOR "MEMORY SIZE".
IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO SET THE "TERMINAL WIDTH" TO 63 FOR USE WITH THE VDM.

3.) AFTER BASIC IS INITIALIZED AND PRINTS "OK", TYPE "NEW", TYPE "NULL 0", AND LOAD IN THE BASIC-VDM DRIVER PROGRAM.

4.) PUT SENSE SWITCH A8 UP AND TYPE 'RUN'.
THE PROGRAM WILL ASK FOR INFORMATION REGARDING DESTINATION LOCATION, VDM MEMORY ADDRESS, VDM PORT ASSIGNMENT, ETC...
"WAIT A MOMENT......"   !!!   IMPORTANT !!!
WHEN THE PROGRAM TYPES "WAIT A MOMENT.....", IT IS PEEKING THROUGH ITSELF TO DETERMINE STATUS AND I/O VALUES, PATCH POINTS, AND LOADING THE VDM DRIVER SOFTWARE INTO MEMORY.  THIS MAY TAKE 30 TO 60 SECONDS.  ALL THE FRONT PANEL LIGHTS GO ON AND THEY LOOK VERY STILL;  BUT DON'T START TO WORRY THAT THE PROGRAM HAS CRASHED...UNTIL ABOUT 2 MINUTES.......THEN WORRY.

5.) SENSE SWITCH A8 WILL NOW CONTROL THE DESTINATION OF OUTPUT.  WHEN THE SWITCH IS UP, DATA WILL GO TO THE DEVICE BASIC WAS SET UP FOR SUCH AS A TELETYPE.  WITH THE SWITCH DOWN, THE DATA WILL BE DISPLAYED ON THE TV SCREEN.  THE SWITCH MAY BE CHANGED AT ANY TIME, INCLUDING DURING OUTPUT.

6.) TYPE CONTROL Z
THE FIRST TIME THE SCREEN IS ACCESSED IT MUST BE INITIALIZED.
