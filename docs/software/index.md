# Software
The VDM-1 enjoyed broad software support, most likely thanks in large part to the ease of writing compatible software.  All software for the VDM-1 works identically for the VDM-2021.

- The famous Trek-80 game, created by Steve Dompier.
    - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trek-80)
    - [Manual](trek80.pdf)
    - [Hex](trek80.hex)
    - [Bin](trek80.bin)
- The VDM-1 Basic Driver
    - [Instructions from VDM-1 manual](vdmdrv.bas.txt)
    - [Basic VDM-1 driver](vdmdrv.bas)
- The VDM-1 Assembly Driver
- CPM-1 could be built using the VDM-1 as the output device.
    - Note: I intend to document this in the coming weeks.
- Much much more

I intend to update this page and document how to utilize the VDM-2021 with various software.  Please send me any information you think should be contained here!
